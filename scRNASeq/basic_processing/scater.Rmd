**Purpose**: Quantification, EDA and normalization for single-cell RNA-Seq data. 

* Designed to go from raw reads to processed, tidy dataset for downstream analyses using other Bioconductor packages (e.g. `Rtsne` for dim reduction, `edgeR` and `limma` for differential expression, `ggplot2` for plotting, etc). 
* Compatible with counts or other transformed expression values (e.g. TPM, FPKM, CPM, etc). 

This R/Bioconductor package includes:

1. Wrapper functions for transcript/Gene quantification using pseudoalignments (Salmon or Kallisto) to calculate gene-level expression values
2. A new `SCESet` (single-cell `ExpressionSet`) class in Bioconductor
3. Automated calculation of QC meterics (feature-level and cell-level); filtering
4. Data visualization to QC metrics
5. Normalization and batch correction methods to **identify** and **remove** uninteresting covariates

# Pre-process outside of scater

#### quality control 

scater assumes **FASTQ files** of individual cells have been assessed and
removed based on quality control metrics based on bulk RNA-Seq metrics. 
For example, use `fastqc`, identify and remove libraries that 
are heavily degraded, libraries with a large amount of ribosomal, 
mitochondirla or other RNA type. 


# The `SCESet` Data Class in scater

This class holds the expression values. Class structure is derived from the `ExpressionSet` class in Bioconductor's Biobase package (derived for microarray and bulk RNA-Seq analyses; allows assay data, gene/transcript metadata, and sample metadata). Adds additional slots to store: 

1. reduced-dimension representation of data for data viz 
2. cell-cell **and** gene-gene pairwise distance matrices for clustering or regulatory network reconstruction
3. bootstrapped expression results to assess accuracy for quantification (e.g. from Kallisto)
4. info about feature/cell controls for normalization (e.g. ERCC spike-ins/control genes), QC, detect highly variable genes, etc
5. epigenetic info or FACS marker expression data

To create a `SCESet` object, use `newSCESet()` and provided three data sets: 

* `countData` = numeric matrix of counts (rows = genes, columns = cells). In this case, the `exprs` slot in the object will be generated as `log2(counts-per-million)` using the `edgeR::cpm()` function, with a "prior count" value of 1.
* `phenoData` = An `AnnotatedDataFrame` describing phenotypic information for each cell (e.g. group, batch, etc)
* `featureData` = An `AnnotatedDataFrame` describing gene-level information for each gene (e.g. gc content, ensemble gene name, etc)
    
You can also provide the normalized expression values **without needing to provide the count data**

* `exprsData` = numeric matrix of expression values (rows = genes, columns = cells). The `scater` vignette states: "Typically these should be `log2(counts-per-million)` values or `log2(reads-per-kilobase-per-million-mapped)`, appropriately normalised of course. The package will generally assume that these are the values to use for expression." You can add the count data afterwards using the `counts(object)` function. 


# Reading in Data

* `newSCESet()`: creates a new `SCESet` object. Requires the `phenoData` and `featureData` object to be an `AnnotatedDataFrame`. 

Example: 
```{r}
# define cell level data set (phenotypic data)
pdMat <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", data = sc_example_cell_info)
rownames(pdMat) <- pdMat$Cell

# define feature level data set (gene level)
gene_df <- data.frame(Gene = rownames(sc_example_counts))
rownames(gene_df) <- gene_df$Gene
fdMat <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", data = gene_df)

scMat <- newSCESet(countData = sc_example_counts, phenoData = pdMat, featureData = fdMat)
scMat

# to add a different expression matrix e.g. with avg count of 5 to avoid log(0)
exprs(scMat) <- edgeR::cpm.default(counts(scMat), prior.count = 5, log = TRUE)

# or can create a new SCESet object with only expression data 
#   Note: no count data, phenoData or featureData needed, though not recommended.
scMat2 <- newSCESet(exprsData = edgeR::cpm.default(scMat, prior.count = 5, log = TRUE))
```


# Quality Control and Diagnostics

Uses the `SCESet` object:

* `is_exprs(object)`: returns a logical matrix indicating whether each feature expression observation is above the defined `lowerDetectionLimit` (default is 0). This can be determined on the count scale or the "expression" (i.e. `exprs(object)`) scale.
* `calcIsExprs(object, lowerDetectionLimit = 100)`: varies the detection limit threshold
* `counts(object)`: returns feature counts
* `calculateQCMetrics(object, feature_controls = 1:92, cell_controls = list(set_1 = 1:5, set_2 = 31:40))`: calculates quality control metrics. Can define **feature** and **cell** controls. Can define more than one set of feature/cell controls using `list()`
* `scater_gui(object)`: opens an interactive dashboard to play around with data using a graphical user interface (GUI)

#### Create logical matrix of which features are being expressed

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is_exprs(scMat) <- calcIsExprs(scMat, lowerDetectionLimit = 4, 
                               exprs_data = "exprs")
head(is_exprs(scMat))
```

filter out genes that are not expressed with a lowerDectionLimit of 5
```{r, eval= FALSE}
keep_genes <- rowSums(is_exprs(scMat)) > 5
scMat <- scMat[keep_genes, ]
```


## Quality control metrics

The authors state: "Following QC, we can proceed with data 
normalisation before downstream analysis and modelling." 

Authors split the QC metrics/plots into three steps: 

1. QC and filtering of cells
2. QC and filtering of features (e.g. genes)
3. QC of experimental variables

Many of the functions in the QC are plots to explore and identify
problems (e.g. features or cells that need to be removed). The 
function `calculateQCMetrics()` is used to compute 
commonly used QC metrics. Controls (features or cells) can 
be defined. 

```{r}
scMat <- calculateQCMetrics(scMat, feature_controls = 1:92, cell_controls = 1:5)
varLabels(scMat) # lists all QC metrics
```


#### QC and filtering cells

The `calculateQCMetrics()` function adds the following columns to `pData(object)`:

Cell-level QC metric | Description 
--- | ---
`total_counts` | total number of counts for the cell (aka 'library size')
`log10_total_counts` | total_counts on the `log10`-scale
`total_features` | the number of features for the cell that have expression above the detection limit (default detection limit is zero)
`filter_on_total_counts` | would this cell be filtered out based on its `log10-total_counts` being (by default) more than 5 median absolute deviations from the median `log10-total_counts` for the dataset?
`filter_on_total_features` | would this cell be filtered out based on its `total_features` being (by default) more than 5 median absolute deviations from the median `total_features` for the dataset?
`counts_feature_controls` | total number of counts for the cell that come from (a set of user-defined) control features. Defaults to zero if no control features are indicated.
`counts_endogenous_features` | total number of counts for the cell that come from endogenous features (i.e. not control features). Defaults to `total_counts` if no control features are indicated.
`log10_counts_feature_controls` | total number of counts from control features on the `log10`-scale. Defaults to zero (i.e. `log10(0 + 1)`, offset to avoid infinite values) if no control features are indicated.
`log10_counts_endogenous_features` | total number of counts from endogenous features on the `log10`-scale. Defaults to zero (i.e. `log10(0 + 1)`, offset to avoid infinite values) if no control features are indicated.
`n_detected_feature_controls` | number of defined feature controls that have expression greater than the threshold defined in the object. 
`pct_counts_feature_controls` | percentage of all counts that come from the defined control features. Defaults to zero if no control features are defined.

Other notes about filtering cells: 

* Multiple sets of feature controls can be defined
* Where `counts` appear above, similar metrics can be computed for `exprs`, `tpm` and `fpkm`



#### QC and filtering features

The `calculateQCMetrics()` function adds the following columns to `fData(object)`:

Feature-level QC metric | Description 
--- | ---
`mean_exprs` | the mean expression level of the gene/feature.
`exprs_rank` | the rank of the feature's expression level in the cell.
`total_feature_counts` | the total number of counts mapped to that feature across all cells.
`log10_total_feature_counts` | total feature counts on the `log10`-scale.
`pct_total_counts` | the percentage of all counts that are accounted for by the counts mapping to the feature.
`is_feature_control` | is the feature a control feature? Default is `FALSE` unless control features are defined by the user.
`n_cells_exprs` | the number of cells for which the expression level of the feature is above the detection limit (default detection limit is zero).


#### QC of experimental variables

TBA


# Many plot functions available for `SCESet` object

**Many** plotting functions are available for visualising the data. Many of 
the plots create can facet or group the gene expression by factors. 

#### `plot()`

Gives an overview of expression across cells. Plots cumulative proportion of each cell's library that is accounted for by the highest-expressed features (default showing top 500 features); shows differences in expression distributions across cells (similar idea to boxplots)

  * `plot(object, block1 = "groupFactor1", block2 = "groupFactor2", nfeatures = 500, exprs_values = "counts")`
  * uses TPM as default (or will use `exprs(object)`). Other values can be specified with `exprs_values` argument (e.g. `exprs`, `tpm` and `fpkm`)
  * `block1` and `block2` are optional arguments that can create a faceted set of plots separated by `groupFactor1` phenotypic factor information in `phenoData` (e.g. batch). Allows user to see large differences in distributions of expression across experimental blocks, batches, etc. 

```{r}
plot(scMat) 

plot(scMat, block1 = "Mutation_Status", block2 = "Treatment",
     colour_by = "Cell_Cycle", nfeatures = 300, exprs_values = "counts")
```

#### `plotExpression()`

Plot expression levels for a defined set of features

  * `plotExpression(object, rownames(scMat)[1:6], x = "groupFactor1", showMedian = FALSE, show_violin = TRUE)`
  * the optional `x` argument splits each feature based on some phenotypic information (e.g. mutation status, batch)
  
```{r}
plotExpression(scMat, rownames(scMat)[1:6],
               x = "Mutation_Status", exprs_values = "exprs")

plotExpression(scMat, rownames(scMat)[7:12],
               x = "Mutation_Status", exprs_values = "counts", colour = "Cell_Cycle",
               show_median = FALSE, show_violin = TRUE,  xlab = "Mutation Status",
               log = TRUE)
```


#### `plotQC()`

Methods to produce various QC diagnostic plots.

  * `plotQC(object, type = "highest-expression", exprs_values = "tpm")`
    * `type = "highest-expression"`: plot the most expressed features across the dataset. Default shows top 50 features.
    * `type = "exprs-freq-vs-mean"`: plot frequency of expression (number of cells with expression for a gene above the defined threshold) vs mean expression level. Gives an idea of technical noise in data set. 
  * Note: Vignette states you can use `multiplot` function to plot multiple `ggplot2` plots on the same page. 
  * Find the most important PCs for a given cell phenotype or metadata variable (from `pData(object)`)
  * Plot a set of cell phenotype/metadata variables against each other and calculating the (marginal) percentage of feature expression variance that they explain
  

```{r}
# filter features
keep_feature <- rowSums(is_exprs(scMat)) > 4
scMatSub <- scMat[keep_feature,]

## Plot QC
plotQC(scMatSub, type = "highest-expression")
plotQC(scMatSub, type = "exprs-freq-vs-mean")
```

#### `plotFeatureData()` 

Plot **feature** metadata and QC metrics. Can identify problematic cells by exploring relationship bewteen QC metrics computed from `calculateQCMetrics()`. Output is a `ggplot2` object.

* `plotFeatureData(object, aes(x = n_cells_exprs, y = pct_total_counts))`

```{r}
plotFeatureData(scMat, aes(x = n_cells_exprs, y = pct_total_counts))
```

Shows a small number of features that are ubiquitously expressed expressed in all cells (`n_cells_exprs`) and account for a large proportion of all counts observed (`pct_total_counts`; more than 0.5% of all counts).


#### `plotPhenoData()`

Plot **cell** metadata and QC metrics. Output is a `ggplot2` object.

* `plotPhenoData(object, aes(x = total_counts, y = total_features, colour = groupFactor1))` 

```{r}
plotPhenoData(scMat, aes(x = total_counts, y = total_features,
                                  colour = Mutation_Status))

plotPhenoData(scMat, aes(x = Mutation_Status, y = total_features,
                                  colour = log10_total_counts))
```


#### `plotPCA()`

Produce a PCA plot for visualizing the cells. PCs calculated using 500 features with **most variable expression across all cells** (can be changed with `ntop` argument) from the `exprs` slot (but can be changed e.g. `exprs_values="cpm"`). 

* `plotPCA(object, ntop=500, exprs_values="exprs")`: p
    * `feature_set = fData(object)$is_feature_control`: if control features are defined, you can use only these to calculate PCs. 
    * `ncomponents = 4, colour_by = "Treatment", shape_by = "Mutation_Status"`: allows more than 2 PCs to be plotted and allows phenotypic information to be defined using colour, shapes, size etc. 
    * `object <- plotPCA(object)`: the `SCESet` object has a `reducedDimension` slot which stores the top PCs. This can be accessed using the `reducedDimension()` function (e.g. `reducedDimension(object)`).

```{r}
plotPCA(scMat)
```


Other plot functions. 

* `plotTSNE(object, colour_by = "Gene_0001", size_by = "Gene_1000")`: produce a *t*-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (reduced dimension) plot for the cells
* `plotDiffusionMap(object, colour_by = "Gene_0001", size_by = "Gene_1000")`: produce a diffusion map (reduced dimension) plot for the cells
* `plotMDS(object)`: produce a multi-dimensional scaling plot for the cells
* `plotReducedDim(object)`: plot a reduced-dimension representation of the cells



#### Plots

Example: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(scMat) 

plot_genes_jitter(sc[1:2,], grouping = "groupFactor", ncol = 2)
plot_spanning_tree(sc) # plots the order of the cells using PC1 and PC2. 
plot_genes_in_pseudotime(sc_subset, color_by = "Time") 
```

* `plot_genes_jitter(object, grouping = "groupFactor", ncol = 2)` = Create plots of gene expression grouped by factors (only for a small number of genes). Based on the `CellDataSet` object. 
* `plot_spanning_tree(object)` = Plots the minimum spanning tree on cells after applying the `orderCells()` function. 
* `plot_genes_in_pseudotime()` = Plots expression for one or more genes as a function of pseudotime.
